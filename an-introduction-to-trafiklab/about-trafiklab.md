# About Trafiklab

We are multiple actors who want to increase travel by public transport, by enabling the development of better travel services. Therefore we have created Trafiklab.

### How Trafiklab works

Trafiklab is a community for open transportation data. A place that developers can share data and APIs  for public transport in Sweden and easily get the information you need to develop sharp services. We also want to make it easier for you to show off what you've done and to get inspiration from what others have already created. We are proud of the data and the APIs we can show today, but we know that there is much left to do. We are behind Trafiklab would help to open up more sources of data and improve the existing ones.

### The partnership behind Trafiklab

Trafiklab founded in 2011 in cooperation between Interconnection, SL and RISE Victoria. Interconnection links the Swedish public transport companies through services ResRobot and Resplus. Through our APIs, we offer access to all of Sweden's public data. Over time, more and more organizations to come, and we hope of course that even more players want to contribute to make work easier for external service developers.
