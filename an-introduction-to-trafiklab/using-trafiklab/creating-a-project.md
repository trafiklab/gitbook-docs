# Creating a project

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disable browser plugins like Google Translate when creating an project. They are known to cause issues when logging in, creating accounts and creating projects.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You need an account in order to create projects. Haven't created an account yet? [Get started here](creating-an-account.md).
{% endhint %}

After logging in, you can head to [your profile page](https://www.trafiklab.se/user) to create your first project.  In order to do this, head to your personal page, by hovering over your profile name in the top-right corner and selecting "profil och project". Hit the purple "Skapa nytt project" and fill in a cool name for your next project.

After entering a name, you can select which APIs you want to use. Don't worry if you're still unsure about which ones you need - [you can change this and other settings later](). Projects which will be included get marked in purple.

Enter a short description and some tags for your project, so others can easily find it. Thereafter you can press the save button \("spara"\) to create your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only projects with the "lanserat" status are publicly visible.
