# Voice assistant

Most of us have experienced this before. You wake up in the morning, eat some breakfast, get dressed and run out of the door to catch a train or bus. Only to find out it is cancelled, or there are major delays.

While it's impossible to have every train and bus running on time, open data can at least prevent needless runs to the station by letting you shout at your Google Home, Echo Speaker, or your phone to ask about the next bus before you leave. Today we will create our own voice assistant app to provide us with real-time transport data through Google Assistant.

Example code is written in PHP, but any language works. All frameworks are free. No \(credit\) card is required for sign-up. You can create everything yourself based on this tutorial, or you can choose to import the dialogflow agent and/or our server implementation.
