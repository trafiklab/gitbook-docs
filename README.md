# Introduction

We are Trafiklab. We're building a better world, by making public transport easier to use, for everyone. We're doing this by offering open data for all public transport in Sweden, so developers can build anything they can imagine, and users get a choice in how they consume public transport data. Whether you want to look on a TV, search on your computer or smartphone, or talk to a smart speaker in order to know when your train leaves: we're enabling it.
